## Understanding Stack Pointers

[understanding-stack.asm](understanding-stack.asm) shows the behaviour of 8051 stack pointer.

## Path from C-code to 8051 byte code

First install `sdcc` (a small cross compiler for various microcontrollers, [http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)) on your machine. For Windows 10, pre compiled binaries were used. Optionally, add SDCC to `PATH` in order to run `sdcc` from any arbitrary path on your machine.
